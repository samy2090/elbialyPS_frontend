# Mobile Offcanvas Navigation Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a mobile offcanvas navigation menu for the dashboard that opens when the menu button (navbar-btn menu-btn) is clicked on mobile devices.

## What was implemented:

### 1. New Component: MobileOffcanvas.vue
- **Location**: `src/components/dashboard/layout/MobileOffcanvas.vue`
- **Features**:
  - Slide-in navigation menu from the left side
  - Contains all dashboard sections (Home, Explore, Users, Profile, Settings)
  - Same navigation items as MobileBottomNav for consistency
  - Beautiful backdrop blur effect
  - Smooth animations (slideIn, fadeIn, checkIn)
  - User info footer with avatar and details
  - Auto-close on item selection
  - Touch-friendly design

### 2. Updated DashboardView.vue
- **Added**: Import for MobileOffcanvas component
- **Added**: `offcanvasVisible` reactive state
- **Modified**: `toggleSidebar()` method to open offcanvas on mobile instead of sidebar
- **Added**: `closeOffcanvas()` method
- **Updated**: `selectSection()` to close offcanvas when item is selected on mobile
- **Updated**: MobileBottomNav visibility to hide when offcanvas is open
- **Added**: UsersSection component and event handler

### 3. Updated Component Index
- **Added**: MobileOffcanvas export in `src/components/dashboard/index.js`

## How it works:

1. **Desktop behavior**: Menu button toggles sidebar collapse (unchanged)
2. **Mobile behavior**: Menu button opens the offcanvas menu
3. **Navigation**: Users can navigate through dashboard sections from the offcanvas
4. **Auto-close**: Offcanvas closes automatically when:
   - User selects a navigation item
   - User clicks outside the menu (overlay)
   - User clicks the close button

## Key Features:

- **Responsive**: Only shows on mobile devices (< 768px)
- **Smooth animations**: Slide-in effect with backdrop blur
- **Consistent design**: Matches the dashboard's dark theme
- **User-friendly**: Large touch targets and clear visual feedback
- **Active state indicators**: Shows current section with visual highlighting
- **Custom scrollbar**: Styled scrollbar for long navigation lists

## Visual Design:
- Dark theme with glass-morphism effects
- Purple accent color (#8b5cf6) for active states
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Consistent typography and spacing
- Professional layout with header, navigation, and footer sections

The implementation provides a modern, native app-like navigation experience for mobile users while maintaining the existing desktop functionality.
