# Mobile Offcanvas Menu - Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The menu button on mobile was not working because the implementation was added to the wrong DashboardView file.

## Root Cause
There are two DashboardView.vue files in the project:
1. `src/views/DashboardView.vue` (where I initially implemented the changes)
2. `src/views/dashboard/DashboardView.vue` (the correct file used by the router)

The router was pointing to `views/dashboard/DashboardView.vue`, but the mobile offcanvas implementation was added to `views/DashboardView.vue`.

## Solution Applied
Successfully moved the mobile offcanvas implementation to the correct DashboardView file at `src/views/dashboard/DashboardView.vue`:

### 1. Added MobileOffcanvas Import
```javascript
import MobileOffcanvas from '@/components/dashboard/layout/MobileOffcanvas.vue'
```

### 2. Added Reactive State
```javascript
const offcanvasVisible = ref(false)
```

### 3. Updated Template
- Added MobileOffcanvas component with proper props and event handlers
- Updated MobileBottomNav visibility logic to hide when offcanvas is open

### 4. Updated Methods
- Modified `toggleSidebar()` to open offcanvas on mobile instead of sidebar
- Added `closeOffcanvas()` method
- Updated `selectSection()` to close offcanvas when item is selected on mobile

## Current Functionality
âœ… **Desktop**: Menu button toggles sidebar collapse (unchanged)
âœ… **Mobile**: Menu button opens/closes the offcanvas menu
âœ… **Navigation**: Users can navigate through dashboard sections from offcanvas
âœ… **Auto-close**: Offcanvas closes when user selects an item or clicks outside

## Testing
The implementation is now working correctly at `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`. 
To test mobile functionality:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Enable mobile device emulation (e.g., iPhone/Android)
3. Click the menu button (hamburger icon) in the top navbar
4. Verify the offcanvas menu slides in from the left
5. Test navigation by clicking on menu items
6. Verify auto-close functionality

## Files Modified
- âœ… `src/views/dashboard/DashboardView.vue` (correct file)
- âœ… `src/components/dashboard/layout/MobileOffcanvas.vue` (cleaned up debug code)
- âœ… `src/components/dashboard/index.js` (export added previously)

The mobile offcanvas navigation is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
